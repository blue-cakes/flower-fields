# flower fields _(a blog)_
##### welcome to **flower fields**
flower fields is a blog by me. here's a format of how it is supposed to look.
```markdown
introduction page a.k.a sunflower field
recent blogs a.k.a daisy field
programmer blogs a.k.a tulip field
writing blogs a.k.a poppy fields
every day blogs a.k.a jasmine fields
all blogs a.k.a storage area
about me a.k.a visitor's registration area
```
each page will be designed to look like a field!
